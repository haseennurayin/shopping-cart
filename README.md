# shopping-cart

## Another fun and exciting project: I built a web application using html, CSS, JavaScript, and Python Flask via which users can view and buy products.

# Description
- Added the implementation of login and register in such a way that it allows a user to register for an account via a form and login their account. Once the user login, they should be able to see the products they buy and the product information.
- Created a table in the database of the application named product and populated the table with some product information. Product table contains the information of Name, Category, Rating, Price, Quantity.
- Added the functionalities of buy in such a way that it enables a user to buy a product from an available product list.
- Added the functionalities of remove in such a way that it enables a user to remove the product from their buy list.
